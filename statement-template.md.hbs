# Accessibility statement for {{title}}
{{! Note: throughout this document are note sections denoted inside comments (like this) and marked ‘Note'.
There are also additional comments which provide further guidance.
All of these sections should be removed before publication.

Start with a brief explanation of which websites or mobile apps the statement covers.

You can have a single accessibility statement that covers multiple domains, or a separate statement for each domain or
subdomain.
As long as the user can access relevant accessibility information easily from any page on your website. }}

{{! The Home Office has decided to ensure that we have individual accessibility statements for each ‘service' that is
a distinct platform or could be deemed to be manged separately from other services that it links with.
For example, there are several ‘services' within the EU Settlement Scheme that all form part of the same user journey
but are technically separate and managed by different teams.
Each on of those separate parts of the journey needs to have an accessibility statement that represents the issues with
that service. }}

This accessibility statement applies to {{scope}}.

{{! Note: use the section below to make a brief, general statement about what the website allows disabled users to do.
If your testing says one of the features below are not true, remove them. }}
This website is run by {{organisation}}.
We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.
For example, that means you should be able to:
{{#each accessibility-features}}
 - {{this}}
{{/each}}

We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
[AbilityNet] has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.


## How accessible this website is
{{! Note: use this section to provide information that a disabled user can act on - for example, avoid a particular
section of the website, or request an alternative version rather than waste time trying to make it work with their
assistive technology. Try to list in order of most impact to least impact. }}

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible.
You can see a full list of any issues we currently know about in the Non-accessible content section of this statement.

## Technical information about this website's accessibility

The Home Office is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites
and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status
{{! Note: say that the website is fully compliant if the website meets WCAG 2.1 AA standard in full.
Say that it's partially compliant if it meets most requirements of the WCAG 2.1 AA standard.
If it does not meet most requirements of the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, say that it's not compliant.
If the service has not been sufficiently tested say ‘not'.
Only say ‘fully' if it has been given that label following an audit by a reputable accessibility expert approved by the
Home Office Accessibility and Inclusion team.

If your website is either partially compliant or not compliant WCAG 2.1 AA standard, you'll need to explain why.
This will be due to one or both of the following:
 · non-compliances - this means the content in question is in scope of the regulations, but there's an accessibility
   problem with it
 · an exemption - this means the inaccessible content is out of scope of the regulations, or it'd be a disproportionate
   burden for you to make it accessible

These are the legally required ways of expressing the compliance status of your website: }}

{{#if compliance.full}}
This website is fully compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1][wcag-v2] AA standard.
{{else if compliance.partial}}
This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1][wcag-v2] AA standard,
due to the {{compliance.status}} listed below.
{{else}}
This website is not compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1][wcag-v2] AA standard. The
{{compliance.status}} are listed below.
{{/if}}


{{#if compliance.non-accessible}}
## Non-accessible content
{{! Note: if the website is fully compliant with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, you can leave the ‘Non-accessible content'
section out.

Otherwise, do not change the ‘Non-accessible content' heading or the ‘The content listed below is non-accessible for
the following reasons' sentence - they're legally required.

Do not change the ‘Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations', ‘Disproportionate burden' and ‘Content that's
not within the scope of the accessibility regulations' subheadings: they're also legally required.

But if you need to list a lot of problems, you can break these subsections up with further subheadings - for example,
‘Navigation and accessing information' or ‘Interactive tools and transactions'. }}

{{#if compliance.full}}
Currently we have not identified any content that is non-compliant, represents a disproportionate burden, or is outside
of the scope of the regulations.
{{! If you are claiming to be fully compliant, use this wording. }}
{{else}}
The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
{{/if}}

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
{{! Note: In this subsection, list:
 · accessibility problems
 · WCAG 2.1 AA guideline that it failed against. If it is not a WCAG issue but still an accessibility issue you should
   still list the issue.
 · when you plan to fix the problem

Do not include any problems where you're claiming disproportionate burden, or where the problem is outside the scope of
the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below).

Example:
  Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information.
  This fails WCAG guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives.
  We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we'll make sure our
  use of images meets accessibility standards.

When describing issues here try to clearly explain what the problem is and what the effect will be on users.
For example:
  Some of the input fields on the application form do not have clear labels which means they are not described well by
  screen readers.
  This could cause some users to not know what information they need to provide and stop them from completing the form.
  We plan to resolve this problem by [give date].
}}
{{#if compliance.untested}}
Thorough testing to confirm the accessibility of the website against the regulation requirements and WCAG 2.1 AA
standards is on our roadmap, however it has not been completed yet.

This is a failing on our part and means at this time we cannot confirm any known issues of non-compliance.

Because of this we stand ready to make reasonable adjustments for users until formal testing and proactive remediation
plans can be confirmed and ask any users that encounter accessibility issues to get in touch with us to receive support
and to notify us of issues so we can start making improvements.
{{else}}
{{#if non-compliance-list}}
{{non-compliance-list}}
{{else}}
{{! If you are claiming to be fully compliant use this wording. }}
We have not identified any areas of the website that are non-compliant with the regulations or Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (AA).
If you find an issue that we have yet to identify please contact us using one of the routes described in the Feedback
and contact information section of this statement.
{{/if}}
{{/if}}

### Disproportionate burden
{{! Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems you're claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix.

Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden
forever.
If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden may change too. }}
{{#if disproportionate-burden-list}}
{{! It is the Home Office's view that we will not be claiming disproportionate burden at any point.
You must keep this heading so use the text provided.
If you feel you need to discuss a possible disproportionate burden case or other PSBAR related accessibility issue,
please contact access@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk }}
{{disproportionate-burden-list}}
{{else}}
At this time, we have not made any disproportionate burden claims.
{{/if}}

### Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
{{! Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems that fall outside the scope of the accessibility regulations.

For example:

  #### PDFs and other documents
  Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services.
  For example we have PDFs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents.
  By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.

  The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if
  they're not essential to providing our services.
  For example, we do not plan to fix [example of non-essential document].

  Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.

  #### Live video
  We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility
  regulations.
}}
{{#if not-in-scope-list}}
{{not-in-scope-list}}
{{else}}
At this time, we have not identified any content that is not within scope of the accessibility regulations.
{{! If you have no content that is not within scope of the accessibility regulations, use this wording. }}
